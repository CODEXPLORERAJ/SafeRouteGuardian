How is it used?
The terrible consequences of drunk driving and the need to address this issue in our society served as the impetus for SafeRouteGuardian. A service called SafeRouteGuardian uses a combination of audio and facial recognition technology to assess a person's sobriety. This lets us determine if they are competent to operate a vehicle.

Features

Two steps are available in SafeRouteGuardian to detect soberity

First, we trained a face test from scratch using a dataset of both sober and intoxicated individuals.
Secondly, to determine whether a user is slurring, we examined spectrograms and applied an algorithm known as the Levinshtein distance.
